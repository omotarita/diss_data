#Info
My project is an undergraduate dissertation for the fulfillment of my BASc degree at University College London. Iâ€™ve been exploring modelling NFT price movements and would like to use a herding agent-based model to forecast these.  By subsequently evaluating its success using gathered data from OpenSea, I hope to substantiate theories that the volatility and the speculative bubble state of the cryptocurrency market can be strongly attributed to herd behaviour (at least in the case of NFT assets). As such, I aim to support the development of fundamental theories in the nascent field of cryptocurrency behavioural economics.
