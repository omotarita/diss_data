My project is an undergraduate dissertation for the fulfillment of my BASc degree at University College London. Iâ€™ve been exploring modelling NFT price movements and would like to use a herding agent-based model to forecast these.  I hope to create data visualisations of OpenSea's collection stats for 10 NFT collection (Bored Ape Yacht Club, CryptoPunks, Cool Cats, Meebits, Crypto Kitties, Azuki, Noundles, Ghozali Everyday, IreneDAO, The Heart Project) against which I intend to evaluate the success of my forecasts. Being granted an API key would be of invaluable help to my project and, subsequently, the nascent field of cryptocurrency behavioural economics.
